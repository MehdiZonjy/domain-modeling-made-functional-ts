# Domain Modeling Made Functional TypeScript examples

An attempt to translate [Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional) code examples to typescript


I'm using the following fp libraries to drive my solution
 - [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) for  FP ADTs and abstractions
 - [newtype-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/newtype-ts) for isomorphic `newtype` types
 - [fp-ts-contrib](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts-contrib): for `do notation`
 - [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) handy helper functions (specially curried array `map`)
